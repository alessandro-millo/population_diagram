The diagram describes the behavior of a population in temrs of growth or decline. The population is the stock. Births and deaths are respectively the inflow and the outflows which affect the population. In other words, the stock is the present memory of the history of the changing flows in the system.

The birth inflow is affected by the fertility; it is a reinforcing loop: a larger population has a larger fertility. Similarly, the outflow is influenced by the mortality: a higher mortality reduces the population, it is a balancing loop.

The behavior of the system depends on the relationship between these two loops. If fertility and mortality are constant, either the reinforcing loop prevails leading to exponential population growth or the balancing one dominates and the population will die off. Lastly, the two can be equal and bring a stabilization in the population.

So to sum up,

- scenario A: fertility > mortality or reinforcing > balancing ==> exponential growth
- scenario B: fertility < mortality or reinforcing < balancing ==> decline in population
- scenario C: fertility = mortality or reinforcing = balancing ==> stabilization

Realistically fertility and mortality change through time and as a consequence their relationship and the whole behavior of the system change. As illustrated in the figure below, the relationship between the two change through time and so the behavior of the system.

Certaintly fertility and mortality are themselves influenced by other variables and information flows. For instance, they can be affected by an economic boom or social trends (e.g. China one child-policy). What one includes in a model is a question of boundaries. As these examples show the population model is a subsection of a larger model.
